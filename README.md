# DMMF
Dual Morphing Multimode Filter

![alt text](https://github.com/themangoest/DMMF/blob/main/DMMF%20panel%20white.jpg)

The DMMF is a filter power hourse. Besides all the normal filter outputs it has also 2 morphing outputs between filters and 2 seperate enveloppe follower outputs.

- Clean 2-pole (12dB/octave) state-variable design.
- CV-controlled filter response, continuously variable between low-pass, band-pass and high-pass.
- CV inputs with attenuverters for cutoff and resonance.
- Unattenuated frequency CV input, calibrated for 1V/Oct tracking.
- Clean self-oscillation across the audio range, extending into very low frequencies, with constant amplitude.

  Modifications:
  v1
- all HP BP LP needs a 1k resistor to the banana.
- For the missing left HP connection connect the 1k resistor from the last but one header (right bottom) to the banana.
